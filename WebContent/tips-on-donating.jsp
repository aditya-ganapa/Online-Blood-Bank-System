<h2>Tips Before Donating Blood</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the days before your donation, eat healthy, iron-rich foods such as spinach, red meat, fish, poultry, beans, iron-fortified cereals and raisins. This will help maintain a healthy iron level. The number one reason for deferrals is anemia.</li>
<li>Get a good night's sleep.</li>
<li>At least 3 hours before donating, eat a balanced meal and avoid fatty foods, such as hamburgers, fries, or ice cream.</li>
<li>Drink an extra 16 oz. of water and fluids before the donation; you can be deferred for dehydration.</li>
<li>Don't forget to bring a valid government-issued photo ID, a list of medications you are taking, and a list of places you have visited outside of the U.S. in the past 3 years.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h2>Tips During Blood Donation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wear clothing with short sleeves or sleeves that can be raised above the elbow.</li>
<li>If you have a preference of arm or vein that you like the phlebotomist to use for your donation, let them know.</li>
<li>Relax, listen to music, talk to others, or watch movies on our comfortable donor lounge chairs designed specifically for apheresis donations.</li>
<li>Enjoy an assortment of refreshments in our canteen area immediately after donating.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h2>Tips After Donating Blood</h2>
<ul>
<li>Drink plenty of fluids over the next 24-48 hours to replenish any fluids you lost during donation.</li>
<li>Do not skip any meals and make sure to eat after your donation.</li>
<li>Avoid strenuous physical activity or heavy lifting for about 24 hours after donation.</li>
<li>If you feel light headed, lie down, preferably with feet elevated, until the feeling passes.</li>
<li>If something doesn't feel right, call the Donor Center's toll-free number provided to you after your donation.</li>
<li>Enjoy your day and know that you have made a positive difference!</li>
