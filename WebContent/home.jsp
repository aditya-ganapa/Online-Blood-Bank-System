	<h1>Why should we donate blood?</h1>
		Safe blood saves lives and improves health. Blood transfusion is needed for:
		<ul>
			<li>women with complications of pregnancy, such as ectopic pregnancies and haemorrhage before, during or after childbirth;</li>
			<li>children with severe anaemia often resulting from malaria or malnutrition;</li>
			<li>people with severe trauma following man-made and natural disasters; and</li>
			<li>many complex medical and surgical procedures and cancer patients.</li>
		</ul>
		It is also needed for regular transfusions for people with conditions such as thalassaemia and sickle cell disease and is used to make products such as clotting factors for people with haemophilia.
		<br><br>
		There is a constant need for regular blood supply because blood can be stored for only a limited time before use. Regular blood donations by a sufficient number of healthy people are needed to ensure that safe blood will be available whenever and wherever it is needed.
		<br><br>
		Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person - the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components - red cells, platelets and plasma - which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.
